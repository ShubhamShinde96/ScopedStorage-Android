# Scoped Storage - Android

This project is a demonstration of how we can implement Scoped Storage to access and create files in internal & external storage.

Starting from Android 11 google has made it mandatory to use Scoped Storage considering the user's privacy and to avoid unwanted files being left behind after the application is uninstalled by the user.

With this application, the user can view the image files from Internal(App-Specific) & External(Shared) Storage and the user can save the photo in both Internal & External Storage by taking the preview using the camera.
